This was a group project as part of the IN4.0 Talent Academy. We created a coin calculator that allowed the user to input a value and sort it using chosen denominations. The program also allowed the user to convert from pound sterling to US dollars and Malagasy ariary using a real time currency converter. Team members: Jordan Wheeler, David Adewole, Jo Fountain, Ben Sid West, Alex Lescionok.
